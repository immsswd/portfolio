Hey there 👋

I’m a Data Analyst who enjoys turning messy data into clear, meaningful insights. A good part of my time is spent exploring datasets, building dashboards, and answering “what’s really going on here?” using Power BI/Fabric and the Azure stack.

I like working at the intersection of data, business, and technology — transforming raw numbers into visuals and stories that help people make better decisions.

Fueled by coffee ☕ and curiosity, I enjoy experimenting with new features, optimizing reports, and learning better ways to model, analyze, and present data.

When I’m not working with data, you’ll probably find me:

- Tweaking dashboards just for fun
- Exploring cloud tools and analytics platforms
- Getting lost in random tech rabbit holes 🐇
