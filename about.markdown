Hey there! I'm im 👋

I build cool stuff with **Assembly language** [kidding 😁] and break things occasionally (for tech, of course).  
Fueled by coffee ☕ and an endless curiosity for tech, I turn ideas into reality—one bug fix at a time.

When I’m not coding, you can find me attempting to cook edible food or getting lost in random **Wikipedia** rabbit holes 👀.
