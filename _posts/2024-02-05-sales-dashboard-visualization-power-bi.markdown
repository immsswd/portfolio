This report is a great tool to help businesses understand how well they are doing over time. It shows important numbers like total sales, profit, and costs from 2020 to 2022. From the charts, we can see that **Cheese and Drinks were the best-selling items**, and that **sales and profit kept growing steadily**. This means the business is moving in the right direction.

One important insight is how the number of **Top customers** increased a lot—by over 118% in just two years. This shows that more loyal or high-value customers are coming in, which is great for long-term success. This kind of report is useful for making better business decisions and showing clear progress in a simple and visual way.
